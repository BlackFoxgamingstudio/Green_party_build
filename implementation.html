# Green Build Party - Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This implementation guide builds on the Green Build Party Functional Role Breakdown, providing practical guidance for executing sustainable building projects in community settings. While the functional breakdown defines the "what" and "who," this guide focuses on the "how" - offering actionable methodologies, templates, and best practices derived from successful implementations.

## Implementation Principles

The Green Build Party model operates on five core principles that guide all implementation decisions:

1. **Community-Centered Design**: Projects must serve genuine community needs and involve community members in planning and execution.
2. **Sustainability First**: Materials, methods, and outcomes prioritize environmental sustainability at every stage.
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Each build serves as a learning opportunity with deliberate skill-building components.
4. **Scalable Approach**: Designs and processes can scale from small demonstrations to larger community implementations.
5. **Measurable Impact**: Outcomes must be measurable against environmental, social, and economic metrics.

These principles inform every aspect of implementation, from materials selection to volunteer coordination.

## Project Selection Criteria

Successful Green Build Party implementations begin with selecting the right projects. Use the following criteria matrix to evaluate potential projects:

| Criterion | Weight | Questions to Answer | Scoring |
|-----------|:------:|---------------------|---------|
| Community Need | 25% | • Is there clear demand from community members?<br>• Does it address a local sustainability gap?<br>• Will it serve multiple community members? | 1-5 scale based on verified need |
| Technical Feasibility | 20% | • Can it be completed in a single day?<br>• Do we have access to the right expertise?<br>• Are materials and tools readily available? | 1-5 scale based on complexity |
| Educational Value | 20% | • Does it demonstrate key sustainability principles?<br>• Will participants learn valuable skills?<br>• Can it generate teaching materials? | 1-5 scale based on learning opportunities |
| Host Commitment | 15% | • Is the host willing to contribute resources?<br>• Will the host maintain the installation?<br>• Can the host facilitate future knowledge sharing? | 1-5 scale based on commitment level |
| Cost-to-Impact Ratio | 10% | • Is the financial investment proportional to impact?<br>• Can we leverage donated materials?<br>• Will it create ongoing value? | 1-5 scale based on ROI |
| Replicability | 10% | • Can the design be adapted for other sites?<br>• Will it generate reusable documentation?<br>• Does it use accessible materials and methods? | 1-5 scale based on replication potential |

Score each project across these criteria, multiply by weight percentages, and prioritize those with the highest total scores. Projects scoring below 3.0 should undergo redesign or reconsideration.

## Implementation Timeline Expansion
