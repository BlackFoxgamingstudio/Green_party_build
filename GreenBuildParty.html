| Environmental | Water Saved (gallons/yr) | Metering | 0 | 5,000-10,000 | TBD |
| Environmental | Waste Diverted (lbs) | Weighing | 0 | 1,000-2,000 | TBD |
| Social | Volunteers Engaged | Count | 0 | 30-50 | TBD |
| Social | New Skills Learned | Survey | 0 | 60-100 | TBD |
| Social | Community Connections | Network Analysis | 0 | 40-60 | TBD |
| Economic | Money Saved ($) | Calculation | 0 | $5,000-10,000 | TBD |
| Economic | Local Business Engaged | Count | 0 | 5-10 | TBD |

This impact dataset provides the foundation for project evaluation and storytelling, communicating the multi-dimensional value created through each Green Build Party.

### Data Visualization Technical Notes

All charts and diagrams in this document are rendered using the following technologies:

1. **Mermaid.js** - For flowcharts, Gantt charts, and sequence diagrams
2. **Chart.js** - For quantitative data visualizations
3. **D3.js** - For complex interactive visualizations

The raw data for these visualizations is stored in structured JSON format within the application, allowing for dynamic updates and customization based on specific project parameters.

Each visualization is designed to be:
- Responsive across device sizes
- Accessible to screen readers
- Printable for offline reference
- Exportable to common formats (PNG, PDF)

This integrated data-visualization approach ensures that complex project information is presented in the most intuitive and actionable format for all stakeholders.
